// Where the original SimCopter runtime data lives.
//
// Packaged Game targets stage the required data trees from Reference/SimCopterOriginalGame to
// <Package>/SimCopter. Every reader still resolves through this one list so developer checkouts,
// custom builds and the packaged layout behave identically. The search used to be copy-pasted
// into a dozen call sites with slightly different candidates (one hard-coded a developer's S:\
// drive), which made packaged subsystems fail independently and silently.
//
// The candidates are all relative to FPaths::ProjectDir(), which is the repo's `SimCopterRemake/`
// folder in a developer checkout and the staged `<Package>/SimCopterRemake/` folder in a shipped
// build. `../SimCopter` therefore means the repo root in the first case and the folder next to
// SimCopterRemake.exe in the second - one path that reads the same to both audiences.
