# CLAUDE.md

**Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — it holds the instructions for this repo, and they apply to you.**

Then read `Docs/memory/MEMORY.md`, the project's memory index.

The three things that bite most often, so they are also here:

1. **Write everything in the repo.** Memories go in `Docs/memory/` (indexed in
   `Docs/memory/MEMORY.md`); scratch files, build logs and screenshots go in `Docs/scratchpad/`.
   Not in Claude's machine-local memory directory, not in the session temp scratchpad — those are
   untracked and invisible to everyone else.

2. **Build with the wrapper at the repo root**, never `Build.bat` / `Build.sh` directly.
   Windows: `RebuildUnrealCpp.bat` (feed it empty stdin; it ends in `pause`).
   Linux: `UE_ROOT=/path/to/UnrealEngine ./RebuildUnrealCpp.sh`.
   Both pin `-NoLiveCoding`.

3. **This is a decompile-and-port project.** Get ground truth from the original executable before
   changing ported behaviour, cite the `FUN_004xxxxx` you ported from, and keep the original's
   16.16 fixed-point units.

Everything else — layout, tests, the editor MCP, in-game verification, style — is in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

One more worth knowing before you go looking for it: the **MCP config is
`SimCopterRemake/.mcp.json`, in the `.uproject` folder, not the repo root**. A session started at
the repo root registers no MCP tools at all, which looks identical to the server being down. See
[Docs/EditorMcpWorkflow.md](Docs/EditorMcpWorkflow.md).
